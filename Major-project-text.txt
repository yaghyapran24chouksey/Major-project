Creating the Site
If you're ready to start, I can help with the following:

Wireframes and UI/UX Design: We can lay out some wireframes for the site and decide how the layout and sections should look.

Frontend Development: We could start creating the main HTML and CSS, and build out interactive parts with JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js).

Backend and Database Setup: Set up the server, databases, authentication, and integrate payment APIs.

Deployment: Host the website and get it live.

can i have an code for it in the language you just mention in frontend :-

Sure! I'll help you get started with a basic structure using HTML, CSS, and React.js for the frontend. This will provide you with the initial foundation of the website.

Let’s break it down into the following parts:

Homepage (index.html)

React components for the various parts (vendor listings, services, etc.)

Basic styling using CSS (you can extend it later with TailwindCSS or your own custom styling)

1. Setup React Project
First, you need to create a React project if you haven't already. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

bash
Copy
npx create-react-app wedding-planner
cd wedding-planner
npm start
This will create a new React app and start the development server.

2. Basic File Structure
After setting up your React app, you’ll have the following structure:

bash
Copy
/wedding-planner
  /public
    index.html
  /src
    App.js
    index.js
    /components
      Header.js
      Footer.js
      VendorList.js
      ServiceCard.js
    /styles
      App.css
We'll build each component one by one.

3. App Component (App.js)
In your App.js file, you will bring together all components.

jsx
Copy
// src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import './styles/App.css';
import Header from './components/Header';
import VendorList from './components/VendorList';
import Footer from './components/Footer';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header />
      <main>
        <h1 className="title">Wedding Planning Services</h1>
        <VendorList />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
4. Header Component (Header.js)
This will be the navigation bar at the top of the page.

jsx
Copy
// src/components/Header.js
import React from 'react';

function Header() {
  return (
    <header className="header">
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/services">Services</a></li>
          <li><a href="/blog">Blog</a></li>
          <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}

export default Header;
5. VendorList Component (VendorList.js)
This component will list all the wedding vendors, such as venues, decorators, and photographers.

jsx
Copy
// src/components/VendorList.js
import React from 'react';
import ServiceCard from './ServiceCard';

const vendors = [
  { name: "Elegant Venues", category: "Venue", description: "Perfect for weddings with a grand touch.", price: "$2000" },
  { name: "Shiny Lights", category: "Lighting", description: "Magical lights for your wedding night.", price: "$500" },
  { name: "Floral Beauties", category: "Decoration", description: "Elegant floral arrangements.", price: "$700" },
];

function VendorList() {
  return (
    <section className="vendor-list">
      {vendors.map((vendor, index) => (
        <ServiceCard key={index} vendor={vendor} />
      ))}
    </section>
  );
}

export default VendorList;
6. ServiceCard Component (ServiceCard.js)
This component will display each individual vendor’s card.

jsx
Copy
// src/components/ServiceCard.js
import React from 'react';

function ServiceCard({ vendor }) {
  return (
    <div className="service-card">
      <h3>{vendor.name}</h3>
      <p><strong>Category:</strong> {vendor.category}</p>
      <p>{vendor.description}</p>
      <p><strong>Price:</strong> {vendor.price}</p>
      <button>Book Now</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ServiceCard;
7. Footer Component (Footer.js)
A basic footer for the website.

jsx
Copy
// src/components/Footer.js
import React from 'react';

function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer className="footer">
      <p>&copy; 2025 Wedding Planner. All Rights Reserved.</p>
    </footer>
  );
}

export default Footer;
8. Basic Styles (App.css)
Now, let’s add some basic styling in App.css. You can expand this later as needed.

css
Copy
/* src/styles/App.css */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: #f8f8f8;
}

.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.header {
  background-color: #222;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 10px;
}

.header nav ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}

.header nav ul li {
  display: inline;
  margin-right: 20px;
}

.header nav ul li a {
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-size: 18px;
}

.title {
  font-size: 2em;
  margin: 20px;
}

.vendor-list {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin-top: 20px;
}

.service-card {
  background-color: #fff;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px;
  width: 250px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.service-card h3 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

.service-card button {
  background-color: #3c9bff;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-size: 1em;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.service-card button:hover {
  background-color: #2e7ec1;
}

.footer {
  background-color: #222;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
  margin-top: 20px;
}
9. Running the App
To run the app:

Make sure you’re inside the wedding-planner directory in your terminal.

If you haven't installed dependencies yet, run npm install.

Start the development server with npm start.

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app.

10. Extend the Project
You can create more components for things like blogs, a contact form, and a booking page.

Integrate a backend API (with Node.js and Express) to handle real-time vendor availability, bookings, and payments.

Use React Router to set up different routes for pages like the services page, vendor details, and contact page.

Implement state management (such as using React Context or Redux) for more complex features like user authentication and cart/booking system.
